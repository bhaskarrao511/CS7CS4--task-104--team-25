How much data do you need to train machine learning algorithms effectively?

Please refer to the report "ML1819--task-104--team-25.pdf", placed under Assignment 2 folder. In this exercise, we have analysed the impact of data amount on machine learning alogirthm's accuracy. We chose multiple algorithms for classification and prediction tasks.
