How much data do you need to train machine learning algorithms effectively?

Take a look at the result folder inside "bank", especially RainForest and LogReg ones. Thanks, Hamid

Guys, I downloaded the latex template of ACM conference and found the way how can we write on it. So, I want to descripe it here.
There are 3 files, "sample-sigconf.tex", "samplebody-conf.tex", and "sample-bibliography.bib". We should write our text inside the "sample body-conf.tex" and references in the "sample-bibliography.bib" files. Then, we should compile the "sample-sigconf.tex" with LaTex, then with BibTex, and again two times with LaTex. I know, it is funny but it works. :) Thanks, Hamid
