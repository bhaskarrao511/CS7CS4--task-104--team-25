Instructions:
Research Assignment 2 shall be an enhanced version of assignment 1.
You shall not do completely new analyses or write a completely new report but improve what you already have. 
Please do not copy & paste large parts of the text but definitely re-use your written code etc. 
Please do not reference your 1st assignment in the second report (do not write "as shown in our previous assignment...").
Pretend that you never did the first assignment, and just deliver a new better version.
You may add new algorithms and datasets in your analyses but this should not be the focus. 
Focus on the "small" things to improve your results like feature selection, normalization of variables, calculating confidence intervals etc. Most importantly, discuss your results critically. 
Show that you really understood what you did and that you understand the results, and answer the research question.
